# Weather Predictions

In this project, we focus on supervised learning, specifically the process of classification. The goal is to train a model to predict rainfall. Specifically, we are given data such as temperature, humidity, wind, etc., for a particular day in a location and whether it rained the following day at that location. We perform the necessary preprocessing on this data (e.g., one-hot encoding, normalization, etc.) and train various models using different classification algorithms, comparing their performance. Finally, we study the hyperparameters based on specific metrics and derive statistical results to optimize them. We export our predictions to corresponding .csv files.

In the relevant files, you will also find the data used (.csv files).

The project was created as part of the course "Macine Learning" at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA and the aim of this work is NOT to present it as my own research but as my approach to the problems given. We highlight that the project was implemented in Google Colab so parts of the code like the file management was done through this environment.
